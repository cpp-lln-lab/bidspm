## How to truncate data files to 0kb

The following was taken from the BIDS example repo documentation.

You can always write a custom script in your favorite programming language, but
if you need a quick and simple way and have access to a unix based machine
(e.g., OSX, Linux), you can use the `find` command line tool:

```Bash
find <path_to_ds> -type f -name '*.nii' -exec truncate -s 0 {} +
```

which means:

-   in this directory `<path_to_ds>`
-   ... find everything of type "file" (or specify `d` for directory, ...)
-   [optional] ... use `-name` with wildcard `*` to match to particular file
    types
-   ... for each file, execute something
-   ... namely, truncate the file
-   ... to size 0
-   `{}` is where a file name is put automatically (do not modify it)
-   `+` means, this is performed not file-wise but with a bunch of files at
    once. Could also be `\;` to have it one after the other
