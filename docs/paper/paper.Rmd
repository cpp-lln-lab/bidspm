# Abstract

The brain imaging data structure (BIDS) [@gorgolewski_brain_2016] is becoming
the standard for organizing data in neuroscience for several types of imaging
modalities (magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography,
microscopy...).

This has lead to the development of an ecosystem of BIDS app (TODO reference
needed) and BIDS compatible tools (TODO reference needed) that leverage this
standardized data structure to create automated pipelines for the analysis of
neuroimaging data (see for example @esteban_fmriprep_2019).

<!-- Resting state tooboxes -->

But there is no common library that, independently of the imaging modality:

- can index and query data and metadata BIDS dataset (whether they are raw or
  derivatives datasets)
- helps easily create filenames that follow a BIDS pattern
- can interact with the BIDS schema
- implements several of transformers to help using the BIDS statistical models
- can work for both MATLAB and Octave.

BIDS-matlab aims to fill that gap.

# Features

At the moment of the writing of this article, BIDS-matlab has the main following
features.

## Indexing and querying datasets

When a dataset has several dozens of participants with heterogeneous content in
terms of imaging modality or acquisition parameters and with metadata for even a
single data file potentially spread across several JSON files, it can become
difficult to fetch the right file or piece of metadata.

BIDS-matlab can:

- return the layout of a BIDS dataset (`bids.layout`),

- perform queries on that layout to get information about the subjects,
  sessions, runs, modalities, metadata... contained within that dataset
  (`bids.query`).

BIDS-matlab is able to parse files in a BIDS datasets whether they follow the
BIDS schema or not, but require that they follow typical BIDS filenaming
patterns (like those generated by fMRIprep [@esteban_fmriprep_2019] - see
[next section](#creating-bids-valid-filenames) for more details).

One notable extension was made to this filename parsing rule to accommodate
filenames that include a prefix before the standard BIDS filename (for example
`swuasub-01_task-rest_bold.nii` with the prefix `swua`) as prefixing is such a
common way to deal with derivatives filenames.

## Creating BIDS valid filenames

Most files in a BIDS dataset follow a standard naming convention that can be
summarised as follow:

```bash
datatype/sub-subLabel(_entity-label)*_suffix\.ext
```

<!-- test pseudo regex above and add link and example  -->

As of this writing, the BIDS specification supports:

- 12 datatypes (for example: `func`, `anat`, `eeg`...)
- 28 different entities (for example: `ses`, `task`, `acq`...)
- 103 suffixes (for example: `bold`, `T1w`, `events`...)

BIDS has a strict set of rules regarding:

- which suffix and entities are allowed for each datatype,
- which entities are allowed for raw and derivatives data,
- which entities are required or optional for each datatype and suffix,
- which order entities should appear in a filename.

Creating BIDS valid filenames can therefore become a tedious task. BIDS-matlab
`bids.File` class can help by relying on the BIDS schema to validate filenames
upon creation.

## transformers

## Dataset summaries

- generate a human readable report of the content of BIDS data set containing
  anatomical MRI, functional MRI, diffusion weighted imaging, field map data
  (see `bids.report`)

- create summary figures listing the number of files for each subject / session
  and and imaging modality (see `bids.diagnostic`)

![Multisubject dataset content split by task.\label{fig:example}](../source/images/MultisubjectMultimodalFaceProcessing_splitby-task.png){
width=100% }

- access and query the
  [BIDS schema](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/schema.json)
  (`bids.schema`)

- access, query and create basic transformations for the
  [BIDS statistical model](https://bids-standard.github.io/stats-models/)
  (`bids.Model` and `bids.transformers`)

The behavior of this toolbox assumes that it is interacting with a valid BIDS
dataset that should have been validated using
[BIDS-validator](https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-validator/).

## Usage

According to a recent survey of 283 scientist [@paret_survey_2022], 7% of the
101 ones that had used BIDS before had also used BIDS-matlab.

BIDS-matlab is currently used in ASL explore [@mutsaerts_exploreasl_2020] and
BIDSpm [@BIDSpm].
