title: "General: How can I run bidspm from the command line?"
---

You can use the Python CLI of bidspm to run many functionalities from the
terminal.

See the README to see how to install it.

You can also run your matlab script from within your terminal without starting
the MATLAB graphic interface.

For this you first need to know where is the MATLAB application. Here are the
typical location depending on your operating system (where `XXx` corresponds to
the version you use).

-   Windows: `C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R20XXx\bin\matlab.exe`
-   Mac: `/Applications/Matlab_R20XXx.app/bin/matlab`
-   Linux: `/usr/local/MATLAB/R20XXx/bin/matlab`

You can then launch MATLAB from a terminal in a command line only with the
following arguments: `-nodisplay -nosplash -nodesktop`

So on Linux for example:

```bash
/usr/local/MATLAB/R2017a/bin/matlab -nodisplay -nosplash -nodesktop
```

If you are on Mac or Linux, we would recommend adding those aliases to your
`.bashrc` or wherever else you keep your aliases.

```bash
matlab=/usr/local/MATLAB/R20XXx/bin/matlab
matlabcli='/usr/local/MATLAB/R20XXx/bin/matlab -nodisplay -nosplash -nodesktop'
```
