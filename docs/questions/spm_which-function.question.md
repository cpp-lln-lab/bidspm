title: "SPM: How do I know which matlab function performs a given SPM process?"
---

If you are looking for which SPM function does task X, click on the `help`
button in the main SPM menu window, then on the task X (e.g Results): the new
window will tell you the name of the function that performs the task you are
interested in (`spm_results_ui.m` in this case).

Another tip is that usually when you run a given process in SPM, the command
line will display the main function called.

For example clicking on the `Check Reg` button and selecting an image to view
display:

```matlab
SPM12: spm_check_registration (v6245)              13:42:08 - 30/10/2018
========================================================================
Display D:\SPM\spm12\canonical\avg305T1.nii,1
```

This tells you that this called the `spm_check_registration.m` matlab function.

Once you have identified the you can then type either type `help function_name`
if you want some more information about this function or `edit function_name` if
you want to see the code and figure out how the function works.
