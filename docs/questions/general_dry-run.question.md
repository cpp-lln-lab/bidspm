    analysis?"

If you want to set things up but not let SPM actually run the batches you can
use the option:

`opt.dryRun = true()`

This can be useful when debugging. You may still run into errors when SPM jobman
takes over and starts running the batches, but you can at least see if the
batches will be constructed without error and then inspect with the SPM GUI to
make sure everything is fine.
