In the vast majority of cases, if you have not touched anything to your options,
you will overwrite the output.

Two exceptions that actually have time stamps and are not over-written:

-   The `matlabbatches` saved in the `jobs` folders as `.m` and `.json` files.
-   If you have saved your options with `saveOptions` (which is the case for
    most of bidspm actions), then the output `.json` file is saved with a time
    stamp too.

In most of other cases if you don't want to overwrite previous output, you will
have to change the output directory.

For the preprocess action, in general you would have to specify a different
`output_dir`.

For the statistics workflows, you have a few more choices as the name of the
output folders includes information that comes from the options and / or the
BIDS stats model.

The output folder name (generated by `getFFXdir()` for the subject level and by
`getRFXdir()` for the dataset level) should include:

-   the FWHM used on the BOLD images
-   info specified in the `Inputs` section of the BIDS stats model JSON file
    (like the name of the task or the MNI space of the input images)
-   the name of the run level node if it is not one of the default one (like
    `"run level"`).

```bash
  $ ls demos/MoAE/outputs/derivatives/bidspm-stats/sub-01/stats

  # Folder name for a model on the auditory task in SPM's MNI space
  # on data smoothed with a 6mm kernel
  task-auditory_space-IXI549Space_FWHM-6
```
