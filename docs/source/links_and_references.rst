SPM code snippets
=================

`SPM wikibook <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SPM>`_ has some very useful sections.

From John Ashburner on `Tom Nichols blog <https://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/nichols/tag/johns-gems/>`_

From `Rik Henson <http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/rik.henson/personal/analysis/>`_

Some follow along tutorials written a long time ago,
and that probably should be turned into notebooks and updated.

- `Basic file / image manipulation with SPM <https://github.com/Remi-Gau/advanced_fMRI_course/blob/master/Practical%231/practical_1.m>`_
- `HRF, convolution and GLM ("by hand") <https://github.com/Remi-Gau/advanced_fMRI_course/blob/master/Practical%232/practical_2.m>`_
- `Design efficiency <https://github.com/Remi-Gau/advanced_fMRI_course/blob/master/Practical%233/practical_3.m>`_
