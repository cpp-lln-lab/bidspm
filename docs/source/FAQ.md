<a name="bids:-what-is-a-bids-way-to-name-and-store-regions-of-interest-(rois)"></a>
## BIDS: What is a BIDS way to name and store Regions of Interest (ROIs)?

There is no "official" way to name ROI in BIDS, but you can apply BIDS naming
principles to name those.

The closest things to ROI naming are the `masks` for the
[BIDS derivatives](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/05-derivatives/03-imaging.html#masks).

Here is an example from the :ref:`face repetition demo`::

```text
  bidspm-roi
  ├── group
  │   ├── hemi-L_space-MNI_label-V1d_desc-wang_mask.json
  │   ├── hemi-L_space-MNI_label-V1d_desc-wang_mask.nii
  │   ├── hemi-L_space-MNI_label-V1v_desc-wang_mask.json
  │   ├── hemi-L_space-MNI_label-V1v_desc-wang_mask.nii
  │   ├── hemi-R_space-MNI_label-V1d_desc-wang_mask.json
  │   ├── hemi-R_space-MNI_label-V1d_desc-wang_mask.nii
  │   ├── hemi-R_space-MNI_label-V1v_desc-wang_mask.json
  │   └── hemi-R_space-MNI_label-V1v_desc-wang_mask.nii
  └── sub-01
      └── roi
          ├── sub-01_hemi-L_space-individual_label-V1d_desc-wang_mask.nii
          ├── sub-01_hemi-L_space-individual_label-V1v_desc-wang_mask.nii
          ├── sub-01_hemi-R_space-individual_label-V1d_desc-wang_mask.nii
          └── sub-01_hemi-R_space-individual_label-V1v_desc-wang_mask.nii
```

ROIs that are defined in some MNI space are going to be the same across
subjects, so you could store a "group" folder (this is not BIDSy but is less
redundant than having a copy of the same file for each subject).

The `desc` entity (description) here is used to denotate the atlas the ROI taken
from, so if you are building yours from a localizer you might not need to use
it.

Ideally you would want to add a JSON file to add metadata about those ROIs.

You can use bids-matlab to help you create BIDS valid filenames.

```matlab
  >> name_spec.ext = '.nii';
  >> name_spec.suffix = 'mask';
  >> name_spec.entities = struct( ...
                                'hemi', 'R', ...
                                'space', 'MNI', ...
                                'label', 'V1v', ...
                                'desc', 'wang');
  >> file = bids.File(name_spec);
  >> file.filename

     hemi-R_space-MNI_label-V1v_desc-wang_mask.nii
```

## General: How can I know that things are set up properly before I run an analysis?

If you want to set things up but not let SPM actually run the batches you can
use the option:

`opt.dryRun = true()`

This can be useful when debugging. You may still run into errors when SPM jobman
takes over and starts running the batches, but you can at least see if the
batches will be constructed without error and then inspect with the SPM GUI to
make sure everything is fine.

<a name="general:-how-can-i-prevent-from-having-spm-windows-pop-up-all-the-time"></a>
## General: How can I prevent from having SPM windows pop up all the time?

Running large number of batches when the GUI of MATLAB is active can be
annoying, as SPM windows will always pop up and become active instead of running
in the background like most users would prefer to.

One easy solution is to add a `spm_my_defaults` function with the following
content in the MATLAB path, or in the directory where you are running your
scripts or command from.

```matlab
function spm_my_defaults

  global defaults

  defaults.cmdline = true;

end
```

This should be picked up by bidspm and SPM upon initialization and ensure that
SPM runs in command line mode.

<a name="general:-how-can-i-run-bidspm-from-the-command-line"></a>
## General: How can I run bidspm from the command line?

You can use the Python CLI of bidspm to run many functionalities from the
terminal.

See the README to see how to install it.

You can also run your matlab script from within your terminal without starting
the MATLAB graphic interface.

For this you first need to know where is the MATLAB application. Here are the
typical location depending on your operating system (where `XXx` corresponds to
the version you use).

-   Windows: `C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R20XXx\bin\matlab.exe`
-   Mac: `/Applications/Matlab_R20XXx.app/bin/matlab`
-   Linux: `/usr/local/MATLAB/R20XXx/bin/matlab`

You can then launch MATLAB from a terminal in a command line only with the
following arguments: `-nodisplay -nosplash -nodesktop`

So on Linux for example:

```bash
/usr/local/MATLAB/R2017a/bin/matlab -nodisplay -nosplash -nodesktop
```

If you are on Mac or Linux, we would recommend adding those aliases to your
`.bashrc` or wherever else you keep your aliases.

```bash
matlab=/usr/local/MATLAB/R20XXx/bin/matlab
matlabcli='/usr/local/MATLAB/R20XXx/bin/matlab -nodisplay -nosplash -nodesktop'
```

<a name="general:-how-can-i-run-bidspm-only-certain-files,-like-just-the-session-`02`-for-example"></a>
## General: How can I run bidspm only certain files, like just the session `02` for example?

Currently there are 2 ways of doing this.

-   using the `bids_filter_file` parameter or an equivalent
    `bids_filter_file.json` file or its counterpart field `opt.bidsFilterFile`
-   using the `opt.query` option field.

On the long run the plan is to use only the `bids_filter_file`, but for now both
possibilities should work.

### `bids filter file`

This is similar to the way you can "select" only certain files to preprocess
with
[fmriprep](https://fmriprep.org/en/stable/faq.html#how-do-i-select-only-certain-files-to-be-input-to-fmriprep).

You can use a `opt.bidsFilterFile` field in your options to define a typical
images "bold", "T1w" in terms of their BIDS entities. The default value is:

```matlab
struct('fmap', struct('modality', 'fmap'), ...
       'bold', struct('modality', 'func', 'suffix', 'bold'), ...
       't2w',  struct('modality', 'anat', 'suffix', 'T2w'), ...
       't1w',  struct('modality', 'anat', 'space', '', 'suffix', 'T1w'), ...
       'roi',  struct('modality', 'roi', 'suffix', 'mask'));
```

Similarly when using the bidspm you can use the argument `bids_filter_file` to
pass a structure or point to a JSON file that would also define typical images
"bold", "T1w"...

The default content in this case would be:

```json
{
    "fmap": { "datatype": "fmap" },
    "bold": { "datatype": "func", "suffix": "bold" },
    "t2w": { "datatype": "anat", "suffix": "T2w" },
    "t1w": { "datatype": "anat", "space": "", "suffix": "T1w" },
    "roi": { "datatype": "roi", "suffix": "mask" }
}
```

So if you wanted to run your analysis on say run `02` and `05` of session `02`,
you would define a json file this file like this:

```json
{
    "fmap": { "datatype": "fmap" },
    "bold": {
        "datatype": "func",
        "suffix": "bold",
        "ses": "02",
        "run": ["02", "05"]
    },
    "t2w": { "datatype": "anat", "suffix": "T2w" },
    "t1w": { "datatype": "anat", "space": "", "suffix": "T1w" },
    "roi": { "datatype": "roi", "suffix": "mask" }
}
```

### `opt.query`

You can select a subset of your data by using the `opt.query`.

This will create a "filter" that bids-matlab will use to only "query" and
retrieve the subset of files that match the requirement of that filter

In "pure" bids-matlab it would look like:

```matlab
  BIDS = bids.layout(path_to_my_dataset)
  bids.query(BIDS, 'data', opt.query)
```

So if you wanted to run your analysis on say run `02` and `05` of session `02`,
you would define your filter like this:

```matlab
  opt.query.ses = '02'
  opt.query.run = {'02', '05'}
```

<a name="general:-what-happens-if-we-run-same-code-twice"></a>
## General: What happens if we run same code twice?

In the vast majority of cases, if you have not touched anything to your options,
you will overwrite the output.

Two exceptions that actually have time stamps and are not over-written:

-   The `matlabbatches` saved in the `jobs` folders as `.m` and `.json` files.
-   If you have saved your options with `saveOptions` (which is the case for
    most of bidspm actions), then the output `.json` file is saved with a time
    stamp too.

In most of other cases if you don't want to overwrite previous output, you will
have to change the output directory.

For the preprocess action, in general you would have to specify a different
`output_dir`.

For the statistics workflows, you have a few more choices as the name of the
output folders includes information that comes from the options and / or the
BIDS stats model.

The output folder name (generated by `getFFXdir()` for the subject level and by
`getRFXdir()` for the dataset level) should include:

-   the FWHM used on the BOLD images
-   info specified in the `Inputs` section of the BIDS stats model JSON file
    (like the name of the task or the MNI space of the input images)
-   the name of the run level node if it is not one of the default one (like
    `"run level"`).

```bash
  $ ls demos/MoAE/outputs/derivatives/bidspm-stats/sub-01/stats

  # Folder name for a model on the auditory task in SPM's MNI space
  # on data smoothed with a 6mm kernel
  task-auditory_space-IXI549Space_FWHM-6
```

See
[this question for more details](#statistics:-how-can-change-the-name-of-the-folder-of-the-subject-level-analysis).

<a name="results:-how-can-i-change-which-slices-are-shown-in-a-montage"></a>
## Results: How can I change which slices are shown in a montage?

> In `bidsspm(..., 'action', 'results', ...)`
> I get an image with the overlay of different slices.
> How can I change which slices are shown?

When you define your options the range of slices that are to be shown can be
changed like this (see `bidsResults` help section for more information):

```matlab
    % slices position in mm [a scalar or a vector]
    opt.results(1).montage.slices = -12:4:60;

    % slices orientation: can be 'axial' 'sagittal' or 'coronal'
    % axial is default
    opt.results(1).montage.orientation = 'axial';
```

<a name="spm:-how-can-get-the-data-from-some-specific-voxel-in-a-nifti-image"></a>
## SPM: How can get the data from some specific voxel in a nifti image?

### `spm_read_vols`

This can be done with the `spm_read_vols` function.

```matlab
% get header of Nifti images
header = spm_vol(path_to_image);
% get the data
data = spm_read_vols(header);
```

`data` is an array of size (x, y, z, t) with x, y and z being the spatial dimensions
and t being the temporal dimension.

You can access the data in any voxel by using the proper index.

### `spm_get_data`

```matlab
% get header of Nifti images
header = spm_vol(path_to_image);
% define voxels to return
XYZ = [10 20; ...
       20 25; ...
       39 10];
% get the data
data = spm_get_data(header, XYZ)
```

- `header`         - [1 x n] structure array of file headers with `n` being the number of volumes
- `XYZ`       - [3 x m] or [4 x m] location matrix {voxel}

- `data`      - [n x m] double values

<a name="spm:-how-can-i-use-spm-image-calculator-(`imcalc`)-to-create-a-roi"></a>
## SPM: How can I use SPM image calculator (`imcalc`) to create a ROI?

The image calculator utility is accessible in the SPM batch GUI:

`Batch --> SPM --> Util --> Image Calculator`

You can select the input image you want to use to create a ROI (like an atlas
for example), and then set the expression you want to use to only keep certain
voxels as part of the binary mask that will define your ROI.

If you want to keep voxels for your ROI that have a value of 51 or 52 or 53, you
would use the following expression:

```matlab
i1==51 || i1==52 || i1 == 53
```

If you save the batch and its job you will get an .m file that may contain
something like this.

```matlab
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.imcalc.input = fullpath_to_the_image;
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.imcalc.output = 'output';
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.imcalc.outdir = {''};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.imcalc.expression = 'i1==51 || i1==52 || i1 == 53';
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.imcalc.var = struct('name', {}, 'value', {});
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.imcalc.options.dmtx = 0;
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.imcalc.options.mask = 0;
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.imcalc.options.interp = 1;
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.imcalc.options.dtype = 4;
```

<a name="spm:-how-can-set-the-value-of-a-specific-voxel-in-a-nifti-image"></a>
## SPM: How can set the value of a specific voxel in a nifti image?

This can be done with the `spm_write_vols` function.

```matlab
% get nifti header
header = spm_vol(path_to_image);

% get atlas content
content = spm_read_vols(header);

% set the voxel (1,1,1) to 0
x = 1;
y = 1;
z = 1;
content(x,y, z) = 0;

% prepare header for the output
new_header = header;
new_header.fname = 'changed_nifti.nii';

% write mask
spm_write_vol(new_header, content);
```

<a name="spm:-how-do-i-get-the-header-of-a-nifti-image"></a>
## SPM: How do I get the header of a nifti image?

### Getting the header

This can be done with the `spm_vol` function.

```matlab
% get header of Nifti images
header = spm_vol(path_to_image);
```

If the input image is a 4D nifti file, the structure `header` returned will have as many elements
as they are volumes in the file.

The fields of the structures are:

- `header.fname` - the filename of the image.
- `header.dim`   - the x, y and z dimensions of the volume
- `header.dt`    - A 1x2 array.  First element is datatype (see spm_type).
              The second is 1 or 0 depending on the endian-ness.
- `header.pinfo` - plane info for each plane of the volume.
  - `header.pinfo(1,:)` - scale for each plane
  - `header.pinfo((2,:)` - offset for each plane
                   The true voxel intensities of the jth image are given
                   by: `val*header.pinfo(1,j) + header.pinfo(2,j)`
  - `header.pinfo((3,:)` - offset into image (in bytes).
                   If the size of pinfo is 3x1, then the volume is assumed
                   to be contiguous and each plane has the same scalefactor
                   and offset.
- `header.mat`   - a 4x4 affine transformation matrix mapping from
              voxel coordinates to real world coordinates.
              This can also be directly accessed by `spm_get_space`.


### Voxel size

The voxel size are the 3 first values of the main diagonal of `header.mat`.
Get the value along the main diagonal of the matrix and stores it in a
temporary variable.

```matlab
temp = diag(header.mat);
```

Then we only keep the 3 first values of this diagonal to get the x, y, z dimension
of each voxel (in mm) of this image.

```matlab
% the "abs" is there to have the absolute value
VoxelsDimension = abs(temp(1:3));
```

### Getting the voxel subscripts of a given set of world space coordinates

```matlab
% world coordinate in mm
x = 0;
y = 0;
z = 0;
world_space_coordinates = [x; y; z; 1];

% Remember that if a matrix A performs a certain transformation,
% the matrix inv(A) will perform the reverse transformation
voxel_subscripts = inv(header.mat) * world_space_coordinates;

% we need to use 'round' to get a value that is not in between 2 voxels.
voxel_subscripts = round(voxel_subscripts(1:3));
```

### Getting the world space coordinate of a given voxel

```matlab
x = 1;
y = 1;
z = 1;

% We have to pad with an extra one to be able
% to multiply it with the transformation matrix.
voxel_subscripts = [x; y; z; 1];
world_space_coordinates = header.mat * voxel_subscripts;

% Only the three first value of this vector are of interest to us
world_space_coordinates = world_space_coordinates(1:3);
```

<a name="spm:-how-do-i-know-which-matlab-function-performs-a-given-spm-process"></a>
## SPM: How do I know which matlab function performs a given SPM process?

If you are looking for which SPM function does task X, click on the `help`
button in the main SPM menu window, then on the task X (e.g Results): the new
window will tell you the name of the function that performs the task you are
interested in (`spm_results_ui.m` in this case).

Another tip is that usually when you run a given process in SPM, the command
line will display the main function called.

For example clicking on the `Check Reg` button and selecting an image to view
display:

```matlab
SPM12: spm_check_registration (v6245)              13:42:08 - 30/10/2018
========================================================================
Display D:\SPM\spm12\canonical\avg305T1.nii,1
```

This tells you that this called the `spm_check_registration.m` matlab function.

You can also find other interesting suggestions in this discussion of the SPM
mailing list:
[SPM: Peeking under the hood -- how?](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind1803&L=spm&P=R58295&1=spm&9=A&J=on&d=No+Match%3BMatch%3BMatches&z=4).

Once you have identified the you can then type either type `help function_name`
if you want some more information about this function or `edit function_name` if
you want to see the code and figure out how the function works.

<a name="spm:-how-do-i-merge-2-masks-with-spm"></a>
## SPM: How do I merge 2 masks with SPM?

Here is a code snippet to merge 2 masks:

```matlab
path_to_mask_1 = 'FIX_ME';
path_to_mask_2 = 'FIX_ME';

% get header of Nifti images
header_1 = spm_vol(path_to_mask_1);
header_2 = spm_vol(path_to_mask_2);

% if you want to make sure that images are in the same space
% and have same resolution
masks = char({path_to_mask_1; path_to_mask_2});
spm_check_orientations(spm_vol(masks));

% get data of Nifti images
mask_1 = spm_read_vols(header_1);
mask_2 = spm_read_vols(header_2);

% concatenate data along the 4th dimension
merged_mask = cat(4, mask_1, mask_2);

% keep any voxel that has some value along the 4th dimension
merged_mask = any(merged_mask, 4);

% create a new header of the final mask
merged_mask_header = header_1;
merged_mask_header.fname = 'new_mask.nii';

spm_write_vol(merged_mask_header, merged_mask);
```

Also good way to learn about some basic low level functions of SPM.

-   `spm_vol`: reads the header of a 3D or 4D Nifti images
-   `spm_read_vols`: given a header it will get the data of Nifti image
-   `spm_write_vol`: given a header and a 3D matrix, it will write a Nifti image

<a name="spm:-what-is-the-content-of-the-spmmat-file"></a>
## SPM: What is the content of the SPM.mat file?

This is here because SPM has the sad (and bad) Matlabic tradition of using variable names
that have often attempted to replicate the notation in the papers to make engineers
and the generally math enclined happy,
rather than the `TypicalLongVariableNames` that many programmers and new comers
would prefer to see to help with code readability.

<a name="statistics:-how-can-change-the-name-of-the-folder-of-the-subject-level-analysis"></a>
## Statistics: How can change the name of the folder of the subject level analysis?

This can be done by changing the `Name` of the run level `Nodes`
in the BIDS stats model.

If your `Nodes.Name` is one of the "default" values:

- `"run"`
- `"run level"`
- `"run_level"`
- `"run-level"`
- ...

like in the example below

```json
  "Nodes": [
    {
      "Level": "Run",
      "Name": "run_level",
    ...
```

then {func}`src.stats.subject_level.getFFXdir.m` will set the subject level folder to be named as follow:

```text
sub-subLabel
└── task-taskLabel_space-spaceLabel_FWHM-FWHMValue
```

However if your `Nodes.Name` is not one of the "default" values, like this

```json
  "Nodes": [
    {
      "Level": "Run",
      "Name": "parametric",
    ...
```

then the subject level folder to be named as follow:

```text
sub-subLabel
└── task-taskLabel_space-spaceLabel_FWHM-FWHMValue_node-parametric
```

<a name="statistics:-how-can-i-see-what-the-transformation-in-the-bids-stats-model-will-do-to-my-eventstsv"></a>
## Statistics: How can I see what the transformation in the BIDS stats model will do to my events.tsv?

You can use the `bids.util.plot_events` function to help you visualize what events will be used in your GLM.

If you want to vivualize the events file:

```matlab
bids.util.plot_events(path_to_events_files);
```

This assumes the events are listed in the `trial_type` column (though this can be
changed by the `trial_type_col` parameter).

If you want to see what events will be included in your GLM after the transformations
are applied:

```matlab
bids.util.plot_events(path_to_events_files, 'model_file', path_to_bids_stats_model_file);
```

This assumes the transformations to apply are in the root node eof the model.

In case you want to save the output after the transformation:

```matlab
% load the events and the stats model
data = bids.util.tsvread(path_to_events_files);
model = BidsModel('file', path_to_bids_stats_model_file);

% apply the transformation
transformers = model.Nodes{1}.Transformations.Instructions;
[new_content, json] = bids.transformers(transformers, data);

% save the new TSV for inspection to make sure it looks like what we expect
bids.util.tsvwrite(fullfile(pwd, 'new_events.tsv'), new_content);
```

<a name="statistics:-how-should-i-name-my-conditions-in-my-eventstsv"></a>
## Statistics: How should I name my conditions in my events.tsv?

In BIDS format, conditions should be named in the `trial_type` column of the `events.tsv` file.

Some good practices for naming "things" can probably be applied here.

- use only alphanumeric characters, underscores and hyphens,
avoid spaces in the condition names

For example: `foo_bar` is ok, but `f$o}o b^a*r` is not.

- the condition names should be short AND descriptive AND human readable

For example: `1` or `one` or `condition1` are short but not descriptive.

An extra requirement to have condition names that can work with bidspm
is that condition names ending with an underscore followed by one or more digits
may lead to unwanted behavior (error or nothing happening
- see [issue](https://github.com/cpp-lln-lab/bidspm/issues/973))
when computing results of a GLM.

So for example:

`happy_face1` and `house123` are ok, but `happy_face_1` and `house_123`  are not.

If your BIDS dataset has conditions that do not follow this rule,
then you can use
the [`Replace` variable transform](https://github.com/bids-standard/variable-transform/blob/main/spec/munge.md#replace)
in your [BIDS statistical model](https://bidspm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bids_stats_model.html#transformation')
to rename them on the fly without having to manually edit potentially dozens of files.

See also example below.

Say one of your events.tsv files looks like this:

|   onset |   duration | trial_type   |
|--------:|-----------:|:-------------|
|       2 |          2 | happy_face_1 |
|       4 |          2 | house_2      |
|       5 |          2 | happy_face_2 |
|       8 |          2 | house_4      |

You can add the following transformation to the first node (usually the run level node)
of your BIDS stats model.

```json
{
  "Nodes": [
    {
      "Level": "Run",
      "Name": "run_level",
      "GroupBy": [
        "run",
        "subject"
      ],
      "Transformations": {
        "Description": "Replace",
        "Instruction": [
            {
                "Name": "Replace",
                "Input": "trial_type",
                "Replace": [
                    {
                        "key": "happy_face_1",
                        "value": "happy_face1"
                    },
                    {
                        "key": "house_2",
                        "value": "house2"
                    },
                    {
                        "key": "happy_face_2",
                        "value": "happy_face2"
                    },
                    {
                        "key": "house_4",
                        "value": "house4"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    },
      "Model": {
        "X": [
            "trial_type.happy_face*",
            "trial_type.house*"
          ],
        "Description": "the rest of the bids stats model would go below this as usual."

    }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Statistics: How should I structure my data to run my statistical analysis?

The main thing to remember is that bidspm will read the events.tsv files from
your raw BIDS data set and will read the bold images from a `bidspm-preproc`
folder.

If your data was preprocessed with fmriprep, bidspm will first need to copy,
unzip and smooth the data into a `bidspm-preproc` folder

Here is an example of how the data is organized for the MoAE fmriprep demo and
what the `bidspm` BIDS call would look like.

```bash
