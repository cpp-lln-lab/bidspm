## Pre processing

The (f)MRI data were pre-processed with {{>computing_environment}}.

{{! TODO anat only}}
{{! TODO voxel displacement maps}}
{{! TODO mention which task were processed}}

The preprocessing of the functional images was performed in the following order:
{{#dummyScans}}- removing of dummy scans
{{/dummyScans}}
{{#stc}}- slice timing correction
{{/stc}}
- realignment{{#unwarp}} and unwarping{{/unwarp}}

- segmentation{{#skullstrip}} and skullstripping
{{/skullstrip}}
{{#normalization}}- normalization MNI space
{{/normalization}}
{{#smoothing}}- smoothing
{{/smoothing}}

{{>remove_dummies}}
{{>slice_timing}}
Functional scans from each participant were realigned {{#unwarp}}and unwarped {{/unwarp}}
using the mean image as a reference
(SPM single pass; number of degrees of freedom: 6 ;
cost function: least square) (Friston et al, 1995).

The anatomical image was bias field corrected.
The bias field corrected image was segmented {{#normalization}}and normalized to
MNI space
{{! TODO get target resolution from script}}
(target space: IXI549Space;
target resolution: 1 mm;
interpolation: 4th degree b-spline)
{{/normalization}}using a unified segmentation.

{{#skullstrip}}{{>skullstripping}}
{{/skullstrip}}

The mean functional image obtained from realignement was co-registered to the
bias corrected anatomical image
(number of degrees of freedom: 6 ;
cost function: normalized mutual information)
(Friston et al, 1995).
The transformation matrix from this coregistration was applied to all the functional images.

{{#normalization}}
{{! TODO get target resolution from script}}
The deformation field obtained from the segmentation was applied to all the functional images
(target space: IXI549Space;
target resolution: equal to that used at acquisition;
interpolation: 4th degree b-spline).
{{/normalization}}

{{#smoothing}}
Preprocessed functional images were spatially smoothed using a 3D
gaussian kernel (FWHM = {{fwhm.func}} mm).
