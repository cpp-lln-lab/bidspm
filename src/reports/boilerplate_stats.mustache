## fMRI statistical analysis

The fMRI data were analysed with {{>computing_environment}}
The input data were the preprocessed BOLD images in{{space}}space for the task "{{taskName}}".

### Run / subject level analysis

At the subject level, we performed a mass univariate analysis with a linear
regression at each voxel of the brain, using generalized least squares with a
global {{SerialCorrelationCorrection}} model to account for temporal auto-correlation
{{#FAST}}[@corbin2018]{{/FAST}}
and a drift fit with discrete cosine transform basis ({{HighPassFilterCutoffSecs}}seconds cut-off).

{{^roi_based}}Image intensity scaling was done run-wide before statistical modeling such that the mean image would have a mean intracerebral intensity of 100.{{/roi_based}}
{{#roi_based}}ROI based analysis was performed using the MarsBaR toolbox [@brett2002].{{/roi_based}}

We modeled the fMRI experiment in a {{designType}} design with regressors
entered into the run-specific design matrix. The onsets
were convolved with SPM canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF)
{{#derivatives}}and its {{type}} derivatives{{/derivatives}}
for the conditions:
{{#convolve}}
 - `{{variablesToConvolve}}`,
{{/convolve}}.

{{! TODO reference slice for each TR}}
{{#confounds}}
Nuisance covariates included:

{{#variables}}
 - `{{variables.name}}`,
{{/variables}}

{{#motion}}
to account for residual motion artefacts,
{{/motion}}
{{#tissue}}
to regress out signal coming from non grey matter regions,
{{/tissue}}
{{#scrubbing}}
to censor any time points flagged as outlier,
{{/scrubbing}}
{{/confounds}}.

{{#smoothing}}
Contrast images were spatially smoothed using a 3D gaussian kernel (FWHM = {{fwhm.contrast}} mm resulting in a final smoothing equivalent to {{fwhm.cumulative}} mm).

{{#group_level}}
### Group level analysis

Contrast for the following conditions were passed as summary statistics for a group level analysis:
{{#contrasts}}
{{! TODO Table of contrast with weight}}
  - `{{contrasts.name}}`,
{{/contrasts}}
{{/group_level}}
